## Introduction 

This project applies classical machine learning techniques to classify different types of mice based on protein expression data collected from their brain tissues. The study leverages real-world biomedical data and explores the relationship between genotype, treatment, behavior, and protein activity to understand the effects of neurological conditions like Down Syndrome.

## üß† Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify mice into **8 biological classes** formed by combinations of:
- **Genotype**: Control or Trisomic (Down Syndrome model - Ts65Dn)
- **Treatment**: Saline or Memantine
- **Behavioral Task**: Context-Shock or Shock-Context

Using protein expression levels as input features, we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict the biological class of a given mouse.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Can we classify a mouse into one of the 8 predefined biological classes using only its protein expression data?

By solving this problem, we aim to:
- Support biomedical research and drug testing
- Improve understanding of Down Syndrome models
- Identify proteins that could be potential **biomarkers**
